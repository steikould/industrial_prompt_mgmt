# Section 13: Change Management & Adoption

A powerful platform is only valuable if it is widely adopted and effectively used. Technology is often the easy part; driving change in human behavior and workflows is the real challenge. A proactive and empathetic change management strategy is therefore critical to the success of this initiative.

### Stakeholder Engagement

Our strategy is to engage every stakeholder group early and often, ensuring they understand the value proposition from their unique perspective.

-   **Operations Teams:** They are our primary users and partners. We will involve them in pilot programs, celebrate their successes as "quick wins" to build momentum, and provide continuous, on-the-ground training and support. We will emphasize how the platform makes their jobs easier and more effective, not how it replaces their expertise.
-   **Energy/Sustainability Teams:** We will align the platform's goals with corporate energy and sustainability targets, providing them with the data and reporting tools they need to track progress and justify initiatives.
-   **Maintenance Teams:** We will demonstrate the platform's value in reducing emergency call-outs and improving resource allocation through predictive maintenance.
-   **Finance Teams:** We will provide clear, quantifiable data on cost savings and ROI, and integrate the platform's forecasting capabilities into the corporate budget planning process.
-   **Executive Leadership:** We will provide a high-level dashboard with key performance indicators, track business value delivered, and ensure constant alignment with the company's strategic goals.

### Training Program

We will implement a tiered training program to meet the needs of different user groups:

-   **Tier 1: All Users (2-hour introductory session):** Covers the platform overview, dashboard navigation, how to read AI recommendations, and how to use the basic functions of the chat interface.
-   **Tier 2: Power Users (1-day workshop):** A deeper dive for team leads and analysts, covering the concepts behind the feature tables, advanced use of the query builder, feature validation techniques, and scenario modeling.
-   **Tier 3: Data Stewards (2-day bootcamp):** A comprehensive program for the domain experts who will own and manage feature definitions, covering the full feature engineering methodology, metadata management, and quality assurance processes.

### Communication Strategy

A steady stream of communication will keep the platform top-of-mind and encourage adoption.
-   **Weekly:** "Tip of the Week" emails showcasing a useful feature or user success story.
-   **Monthly:** A platform updates newsletter detailing new features and improvements.
-   **Quarterly:** An all-hands demo to showcase progress and celebrate wins.
-   **Ongoing:** A dedicated Slack/Teams channel for users to ask questions and share discoveries, supported by an internal knowledge base and FAQ.

### Measuring Success

We will track adoption and success through a clear set of metrics:
-   **User Adoption Rate:** The percentage of target users who are active on the platform each week.
-   **Query Volume:** The number of queries being run, indicating active engagement.
-   **Recommendation Acceptance Rate:** A key metric for the AI's effectiveness and user trust.
-   **Verified Energy Savings:** The ultimate measure of the platform's financial impact.
-   **User Satisfaction:** Measured through regular Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys.

By treating the rollout as a continuous process of engagement, training, and communication, we can ensure that the platform becomes an indispensable part of the company's operational fabric.
