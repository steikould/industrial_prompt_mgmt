# GCP Serverless Python Development Workflows

This directory contains a collection of prompts and patterns designed to accelerate development for a Python 3.12 serverless team on Google Cloud Platform.

The focus is on:
- **Developer Velocity:** Standardized templates and code generators to ship features faster.
- **GCP Best Practices:** Curated patterns for Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, BigQuery, and Pub/Sub.
- **Consistency:** Enforcing standards for code, infrastructure, and deployments.

## How to Use
- Explore the subdirectories to find relevant prompts for your task.
- Use the `jules-async` CLI (or equivalent) to generate code from these prompts.
- Refer to the `QUICK_START.md` for a tutorial on getting started.
- Consult the `factory-patterns` for creating consistent GCP clients, data processors, and more.
