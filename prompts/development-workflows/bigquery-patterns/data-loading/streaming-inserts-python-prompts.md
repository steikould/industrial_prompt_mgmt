# Prompts for Using the BigQuery Storage Write API (Streaming Inserts)

This file provides prompts for using the BigQuery Storage Write API for high-throughput, real-time data ingestion.

**Why the Storage Write API?**
- It is the recommended method for streaming data into BigQuery, replacing the older, legacy `tabledata.insertAll` streaming API.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Lower Cost:** Cheaper than the legacy API.
    - **Exactly-Once Semantics:** Provides stronger delivery guarantees.
    - **Higher Throughput:** Can handle much higher volumes of data.

**How it Works:**
- The Python client library (`google-cloud-bigquery-storage`) manages a gRPC bi-directional stream to BigQuery.
- You append rows (as serialized protocol buffers) to the stream.
- The client library handles the complexities of connection management, serialization, and retries.

**Key Components (`google-cloud-bigquery-storage`):**
- **`BigQueryWriteClient`:** The main client.
- **`write_rows` method:** The method used to send data.

**Prompt:**
"You need to write a Cloud Function that receives real-time events from Pub/Sub and streams them into a BigQuery table with the best performance and cost-efficiency.
1.  Explain why the Storage Write API is the correct choice for this task compared to the legacy `insertAll` method.
2.  Write a Python function that takes a list of dictionary objects as input.
3.  Inside the function, use the `BigQueryWriteClient` and the `write_rows` method to stream these rows into a specified BigQuery table.
4.  The rows should be serialized into the `protobuf` format before being sent."
