# Prompts for Memory Tuning in Cloud Functions

This file provides prompts for right-sizing the memory allocation for a Cloud Function to optimize performance and cost.

**Key Concepts:**
- **CPU Allocation:** In GCP Cloud Functions, CPU is allocated proportionally to the memory you select. More memory = more CPU.
- **Cost:** Memory is a primary driver of cost. Over-provisioning wastes money.
- **Performance:** Under-provisioning can lead to slow performance or out-of-memory errors. A function that is memory-constrained might run slower, paradoxically increasing costs if its execution time is significantly longer.

**Tuning Process:**
1.  **Start with a baseline:** Deploy your function with a default memory setting (e.g., 256MB).
2.  **Load Test:** Send realistic traffic to your function.
3.  **Analyze Logs:** Go to the Cloud Logging page for your function and look for the "Function execution took..." log entry. This entry includes `memory_usage_mb`, which tells you the peak memory used during the invocation.
4.  **Adjust and Repeat:** Adjust the allocated memory to be slightly higher than the observed peak usage. Re-run the load test to see how performance and cost are affected. The goal is to find the lowest memory setting that still meets your performance requirements.

**Prompt:**
"You have deployed a new Cloud Function, but its performance is unknown. Write a plan to determine the optimal memory allocation. The plan should include load testing, analyzing Cloud Logging metrics for memory usage, and iteratively adjusting the configuration."
