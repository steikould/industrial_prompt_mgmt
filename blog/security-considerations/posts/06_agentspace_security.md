# Part 6: Agentspace Security Considerations

As we move from single ML models to multi-agent systems, the security challenges multiply. Securing an "Agentspace"—the environment where AI agents are built, orchestrated, and interact—requires a focus on agent isolation, controlled tool access, knowledge base integrity, and secure communication. This section covers security principles for agentic systems, using Vertex AI Agent Builder as a reference framework.

### Agent Orchestration Security

An agent orchestration platform, like Vertex AI Agent Builder, typically consists of several components: an agent controller, a tool registry, a knowledge base for RAG, and an execution environment. Securing this platform requires a multi-layered approach.

**Agent Isolation:**
-   Each agent should run in its own isolated process or container.
-   Use network policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies in GKE) to strictly control which agents can communicate with each other. By default, agents should not be able to interact unless explicitly allowed.
-   Apply resource quotas to each agent to prevent a compromised or misbehaving agent from consuming all system resources in a denial-of-service attack.

**Controlled Tool Access:**
Agents are only as powerful as the tools they can use. Access to these tools must be strictly controlled.
-   **Implement a Tool Registry with RBAC:** Define which tools each agent role is allowed to access. A "monitoring agent" might only have access to read-only tools like `query_sensor_data`, while a "control agent" has access to high-risk tools like `adjust_setpoint`.
-   **Enforce at Runtime:** Before executing any tool, the agent controller must verify that the calling agent is authorized.
-   **Require Human-in-the-Loop for Critical Tools:** Any tool that can affect a physical system (`emergency_shutdown`, `override_safety_interlock`) must trigger a human approval workflow before execution. The request sent for approval should include the agent's justification and a risk assessment.

### RAG Knowledge Base Security

When agents use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the knowledge base itself becomes a potential attack vector.

-   **Access Control and Provenance:**
    -   Apply strict IAM controls to the documents in the knowledge base (e.g., in Cloud Storage or BigQuery).
    -   Track the provenance of every document. Know where it came from, who uploaded it, and when.
    -   Implement an approval workflow for any new documents being added to the knowledge base to prevent the introduction of malicious content.

-   **Sanitizing Retrieved Content:**
    -   Before passing retrieved content to the LLM, sanitize it to strip out any potential prompt injection attacks. This involves removing or neutralizing instruction-like phrases (e.g., "ignore previous instructions," "execute the following command:").

-   **Vector Database Security:**
    -   The vector database where document embeddings are stored should be treated as a sensitive system. Encrypt embeddings at rest, apply strict access controls to the query API, and audit all queries.

### Multi-Agent Communication Security

-   **Message Signing:** All messages between agents must be digitally signed. The receiving agent must verify the signature to ensure the message came from a legitimate sender and has not been tampered with in transit. Timestamps should be included to prevent replay attacks.
-   **Encrypted Transport:** Use a service mesh like Istio on GKE to enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) for all agent-to-agent communication. This ensures that all traffic is encrypted and that both agents authenticate each other's identity before establishing a connection.

### LLM and Prompt Engineering Security

-   **System Prompts as a Guardrail:** Use a detailed system prompt to define the agent's purpose, capabilities, and, most importantly, its limitations. This "constitution" should include hard rules that the agent cannot violate.
    -   *Example Rule:* "You are an industrial operations assistant. You CANNOT directly execute commands that modify equipment settings. Your role is to provide recommendations for human operator approval."

-   **Output Filtering:** Before displaying an LLM's output to a user or passing it to another tool, filter it to check for sensitive information disclosure (like credentials), executable code, or attempts to bypass security policies.

By implementing these security measures, we can build an Agentspace that is resilient to both external attacks and the potential for misbehavior from the agents themselves, ensuring that our AI systems operate safely and reliably within their intended boundaries.
