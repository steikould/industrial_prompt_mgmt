# Securing Industrial AI: A Blog Series

Welcome to our series on the critical security considerations for deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in industrial environments. As AI-powered agents and models take on increasingly important roles in managing critical infrastructure like fuel pipelines, understanding and mitigating the unique cybersecurity risks they introduce is paramount.

This series is designed for security architects, MLOps engineers, and Operational Technology (OT) security professionals. We will provide a practical, actionable guide to securing industrial AI deployments, with a focus on attack vectors, defense strategies, and best practices for platforms like Google Cloud Vertex AI.
