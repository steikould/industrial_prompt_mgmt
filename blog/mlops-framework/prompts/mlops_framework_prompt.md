### **Section 1: Industry Context & Problem Statement** (400-500 words)

**Cover:**
- The regulatory landscape: API RP 1130 requirements for computational pipeline monitoring (CPM) systems that use algorithmic approaches to detect hydraulic anomalies in pipeline operating parameters
- Industry standards requiring robustness (continue monitoring in non-ideal conditions) and reliability (minimize false alarms despite high sensitivity)
- The critical role of pump systems, which account for almost 20 percent of the world's energy consumed by electric motors and 25-50 percent of total electric energy usage in industrial facilities
- The challenge: Massive volumes of time-series sensor data from OSIsoft PI System requiring domain-specific ML approaches, not one-size-fits-all solutions
- The gap: Traditional approaches lack automated, scalable frameworks that can apply different ML algorithms to different sensor categories

---

### **Section 2: PI System Architecture & Data Ingestion Challenges** (500-600 words)

**Cover:**
- OSIsoft PI System's role in managing industrial sensor data through a three-step process: collecting data via 450+ interfaces, compressing and archiving massive volumes with industry-strength performance, and contextualizing data for analysis
- The challenge of sensor stream naming conventions (e.g., TI37.109-CP-TK9PV) where only initial users responsible for control system naming can fully benefit, leaving data "dark" and underutilized
- Data preparation challenges: OT data is not uniform and can have outliers like varying identifiers, uneven spacing, spike/out of range values, bad sensor readings, or communication failures, with OSIsoft estimating 50-80% of data scientist time spent on data preparation
- Data extraction considerations: PI Web API for querying historical data, PI Integrator for Business Analytics for cleansing and transformations
- Integration patterns for moving PI data to cloud platforms (AWS S3, Azure, etc.) for advanced analytics

- **ML algorithm mapping**: Each category mapped to appropriate algorithms:
  - Pump bearing monitoring: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM for binary classification (normal/broken)
  - Flow rate anomaly detection: Binary classification and regression models for predicting failure likelihood and remaining useful life (RUL)
  - Short-horizon fault prediction: Random Forest and XGBoost with sliding window feature extraction (60-120 minute windows) for 5, 15, and 30-minute ahead predictions
  - Electrical submersible pumps: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) pipelined with XGBoosting for predicting failures 7 days ahead
- **Feature engineering specifications**: Time windows, aggregations, domain-specific features
