# Part 10: Compliance & Governance

Operating AI systems in a critical infrastructure sector like the fuel pipeline industry means navigating a complex and evolving web of regulations. A strong governance framework is not just a compliance exercise; it's a critical component of ensuring that AI is developed and deployed safely, responsibly, and securely.

### The Regulatory Landscape

Our compliance strategy must address regulations from several domains:

-   **Industry-Specific:** This includes cybersecurity directives from the **TSA** (Transportation Security Administration) issued after the Colonial Pipeline incident, as well as pipeline safety regulations from **PHMSA** (Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration).
-   **AI-Specific:** This is a rapidly emerging area. We must align with the principles of the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** and be prepared for future regulations like the **EU AI Act**, which classifies AI used in critical infrastructure as "high-risk" and imposes strict requirements for transparency, accountability, and human oversight.
-   **General Cybersecurity & Privacy:** We must also adhere to established frameworks like the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, **IEC 62443** for industrial control systems, and data privacy regulations like **GDPR** or **CCPA** if applicable.

### Compliance Implementation

**Comprehensive Audit Logging:**
To meet compliance requirements, we must be able to prove that our systems are operating securely. This requires comprehensive, immutable audit logging of all security-relevant events:
-   All data access (who, what, when, where, and why).
-   All model training, deployment, and versioning events.
-   All prediction requests and their responses.
-   All actions taken by AI agents, including their intermediate reasoning steps.
-   All changes to IAM policies and system configurations.

These logs must be retained securely for periods often specified by regulation (e.g., 7+ years) and should be stored in a way that prevents tampering.

**Model Governance and Model Cards:**
Governance is about ensuring that every model deployed in production is well-understood, documented, and approved. We implement this through the practice of creating a "Model Card" for every production model. This is a living document that includes:

-   **Model Details:** Name, version, and purpose.
-   **Intended Use:** The specific use cases the model is designed for and any known limitations.
-   **Performance Metrics:** The model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics on a standardized validation dataset.
-   **Training Data:** The source, size, and any sensitive data considerations for the data used to train the model.
-   **Ethical Considerations:** An analysis of potential biases and safety risks.
-   **Security Information:** Details on the security measures applied, such as encryption and adversarial testing.
-   **Approval Information:** A record of who developed, reviewed, and approved the model for production use.

This documentation is critical for audits, regulatory inquiries, and for building trust with operators and other stakeholders.

**AI Ethics & Responsible AI:**
Beyond formal compliance, we adhere to a set of core principles for Responsible AI:
1.  **Transparency:** Achieved through explainable AI (XAI) techniques and detailed model cards.
2.  **Accountability:** Ensured through clear ownership, approval workflows, and audit trails.
3.  **Safety:** Guaranteed through robust testing, the inclusion of fail-safes, and a commitment to human-in-the-loop oversight for all critical decisions.
4.  **Privacy:** Implemented by minimizing data collection, de-identifying data where possible, and applying strong access controls.

**Third-Party Risk Management:**
Our governance framework extends to our supply chain. When using any third-party AI service or open-source component, we conduct a thorough security assessment. We maintain a **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** for all our applications, allowing us to track every dependency and quickly respond if a vulnerability is discovered in a component we use.

By building this robust governance framework, we ensure that our use of AI is not only powerful and efficient but also compliant, auditable, and aligned with the highest standards of safety and responsibility required for critical infrastructure.
